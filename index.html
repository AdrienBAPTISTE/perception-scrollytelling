                                We had to create an artistic project related to infinity. Our choice was to create a
                                game. Inspired by the movie Monstre & Cie and Portal, our goal is to dive the spectator
                                into an endless universe. In the form of a virtual reality, the game use a user point of
                                view. The user will face several doors and will have to choose one of them, to enter a
                                room.
                                <br><br>
                                In order to realize this project, we used different softwares such as Blender , in order
                                to design the room, the objects in it and the 3D doors. We also created arms to enhance
                                the user point of view. To associate 3D and game, we use the Unreal Engine 5 software.

                                The different doors can appeal to different worlds, different visions or opinions. Among them, 
                                there is an idea that justifies the name of the project: "Perception". The user can both 
                                perceive : everything and nothing. He can interpret what he wants. A simple door can mean many things.
                                <br><br>
                                As Tom Stoppard says: "Every exit door is a front door something else". Often related to opportunities 
                                we can have in mind the symbol of revival: Closing the door of the past and opening the door of the 
                                future.

                                It is a notion of evolution, growing and moving forward.

                                Infinity is a vast and complex element. Just like the thoughts of Man.<br><br>

                                As Schmitt said :  “A man is made of choices and circumstances. No one has power over circumstances, 
                                but everyone has power over his choices.”<br><br>

                                Indeed, man sees himself all his life facing choices that determine the path of his life. He can 
                                quickly find himself in a loop that is modeled by "To have a choice to make, to choose, ...." and 
                                those until infinity. Man is then quickly stuck in a world of permanent anguish. It is a dissimulated hell.
